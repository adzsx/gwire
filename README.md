# gwire
An encrypted p2p chat system

## Features
- p2p chat, No 3rd party
- multi-user chat
- low on cpu and memory
- Encryption with AES
- Automatic encryption with RSA and AES

## Installation
Download the version for your operating system and run it. 
Optionally you can put it somewhere so you don't need to run the file locally from the directory it is in.
Other than that, there is no installation required

## Usage
Encryption is enabled and set to RSA by default. Use -d to not use encryption
